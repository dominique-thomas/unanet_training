Welcome to the help video for this eLearning website! 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this video, we'll guide you through the basic features and navigation controls of the site.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's start at the top of the page.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The sidebar menu button allows you to toggle the menu open and closed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The Certificate button displays the course certificate, which becomes available once you've passed the final assessment.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The Help button launches a modal window that contains this help video.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The About button opens a modal window that explains the purpose of the site.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The Glossary button opens the glossary modal window, allowing you to view the course glossary.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The resources button opens the resources modal window, which provides a list of local resources such as the course transcript and external resources that you can use to learn about the subject matter.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The User Settings Button opens the User Settings modal window, which allows you to specify your first and lastname.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now that we've covered the top menu, let's discuss the sidebar. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The sidebar displays the title of the course as well as topic links. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Each lesson is broken down by a specific topic. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
As you progress through the course, you will notice the progress indicators. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Take a moment to view the progress indicator icons and descriptions.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is the content area. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
At the top, is the name of the lesson and slide, followed by the slide number. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Here the slide content is displayed. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Although you are not required to complete each slide, it is recommended that you review the material before taking the final assessment.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is an example of the final assessment. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
On the left-hand side of the pane, you'll see the Scenario Overview, which provides instructions on the actions you need to take. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Once you have completed the assessment, click the Finish Assessment button to submit your work. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Note that while the assessment is in progress, navigation to other areas of the site is restricted. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
To resume normal site operation, you must submit your assessment.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Underneath the content area are the Previous Slide and Next Slide navigation buttons. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You can navigate one of three ways throughout the course.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
First, you can use the sidebar links to navigate to a topic of interest. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Second, you can use the Previous and Next Slide buttons to sequentially navigate to the next or previous slide if the buttons are active. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Finally, you can use the keyboard shortcuts Control + Alt + Period to navigate to the next slide and Control + Alt + Comma to navigate to the previous slide.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
