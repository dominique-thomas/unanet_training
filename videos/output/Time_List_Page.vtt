00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This page allows you to view a list of current and past timesheets.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
At the top of the page is the Active Timesheets dropdown. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can use this to toggle a list of all active timesheets that have the status of INUSE, SUBMITTED, or APPROVING. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This page also allows you to create a new Timesheet by clicking the Create Timesheet icon. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For detailed instructions on how to use this feature, refer to the Time - Dashboard Page video.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Finally, at the bottom of the page is the Completed Timesheets dropdown menu. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This menu displays an aggregated list of all completed timesheets. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is useful for historical purposes or if you need to edit a previously completed timesheet. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The most common timesheet statuses for completed timesheets are EXTRACTED (finalized timesheet) and CORRECTED (updated by an admin, requiring your edits).

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Editing a submitted timesheet follows the same process as editing a new one. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
For details on editing a timesheet, refer to the Time - Current Page video. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Note that modifying an approved timesheet will reset its approval status, requiring resubmission.
